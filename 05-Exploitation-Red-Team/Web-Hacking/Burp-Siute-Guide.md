Burp Suite is the primary tool for Web Application Pentesting. You cannot hack the web effectively without it.

# 🟠 Burp Suite Cheat Sheet

**"The X-Ray specs for the web."**

Burp Suite is a proxy that sits between my browser and the target server. It lets me pause a request, modify it, and send it on.

## 🛠️ The Core Modules

### 1. Proxy (Intercept)
*The heart of Burp.*
*   **Intercept On:** Pauses the request before it leaves my computer.
*   **What to check:**
    *   Hidden parameters (`admin=false` -> Change to `true`).
    *   User-Agent strings (Mobile vs. Desktop).
    *   Cookies (Session IDs).

### 2. Repeater (Manual Testing)
*The most used tab.*
*   **Workflow:** Right-click a request -> "Send to Repeater" (Ctrl+R).
*   **Goal:** Modify one thing, hit Send, check response. Repeat.
*   **Use Case:** Testing for SQL Injection. I send `'`, check error. Send `' OR 1=1`, check login.

### 3. Intruder (Automation)
*Brute forcing and fuzzing.*
1.  **Positions:** Highlight the data you want to change (e.g., a password or ID number).
2.  **Payloads:** Load a list (numbers 1-1000, or a wordlist).
3.  **Attack Type:**
    *   **Sniper:** One payload position.
    *   **Battering Ram:** Same payload in multiple places.
    *   **Pitchfork:** Different payloads in different places (simultaneous).
    *   **Cluster Bomb:** Every combination of payloads (Slow but thorough).

### 4. Decoder
*Translate data instantly.*
*   Use this to decode Base64, URL Encoding (`%20`), or Hex.
*   *Tip:* The "Smart Decode" button usually guesses right.

## 🏎️ Pro-Tips for Configuration

### 1. FoxyProxy (Browser Extension)
Don't change your browser settings manually every time. Use the FoxyProxy extension to switch between "Burp" (127.0.0.1:8080) and "Direct" (Normal Internet) in one click.

### 2. Scope (Stop the Noise)
Burp captures EVERYTHING (Google, analytics, ads).
1.  Go to **Target > Scope**.
2.  Add your target IP/Domain.
3.  In Proxy History filter, check **"Show only in-scope items"**.
    *   *Result:* Your history is clean, showing only the target.

### 3. Shortcuts
*   **Ctrl+R:** Send to Repeater.
*   **Ctrl+I:** Send to Intruder.
*   **Ctrl+Shift+U:** URL Decode highlighted text.

## 🕵️ My Burp Workflow
1.  **Walk the App:** Click every button on the website with Intercept **OFF** to populate the site map.
2.  **Filter:** Set the scope to only show the target domain.
3.  **Analyze:** Look at the Proxy History. Are there API calls? Hidden headers?
4.  **Attack:** Send interesting requests (login, upload, profile view) to **Repeater** and start poking.
