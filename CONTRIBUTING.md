# Code of Conduct & Community Guidelines

## 🤝 Our Learning Pact
This repository is a documentation of my personal journey into Cybersecurity. My goal is to create a space where knowledge is shared freely and where beginners feel safe to ask questions.

Because we are dealing with security tools and techniques, this community must be built on **trust, responsibility, and mutual respect**.

## ✅ The Standards
To make this a positive experience for everyone (including future employers who might see this), we agree to the following:

### 1. No Gatekeeping
We were all beginners once.
- **Be Patient:** If someone asks a "basic" question, answer it kindly or point them to a resource.
- **No Ego:** Do not mock others for what they don't know yet. We are here to learn, not to show off.

### 2. White Hat Only (Ethical Hacking)
This is a strict requirement.
- **Educational Use Only:** The tools and scripts here are for learning, CTFs, and defensive testing.
- **No Illegal Activity:** Any discussion, promotion, or encouragement of illegal hacking, unauthorized access, or malware distribution will result in an immediate ban.
- **Stay Legal:** We follow the laws and terms of service of the platforms we study.

### 3. Respect & Inclusivity
We welcome people of all backgrounds, skill levels, and identities.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focus on what helps the community grow.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior
The following will not be tolerated:
- **Harassment:** Public or private harassment, trolling, or insulting comments.
- **Doxxing:** Publishing others' private information without permission.
- **Malicious Intent:** Posting code intentionally designed to harm others' systems without warning/context.

## ⚖️ Enforcement
As the maintainer of this repository, I want to keep this a healthy space.
- I reserve the right to remove comments, close issues, or reject pull requests that violate these guidelines.
- Individuals who repeatedly violate these rules or engage in illegal discussions will be blocked from the repository.

## 📞 Reporting
If you see behavior that makes you uncomfortable or violates these rules, please contact me directly (check the Contact section in the README). I will handle it with discretion.
