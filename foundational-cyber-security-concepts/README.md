# 📚 My Learning Library & Resources

**"You don't need a degree to learn cybersecurity, but you do need the right resources."**

This is a curated list of the books, courses, and labs that I have found most helpful in my journey. Whether you are looking for free introductory courses or deep-dive textbooks, these are my recommendations.

## 🆓 Free Resources (Start Here)
*If you are just starting and have $0 budget, look at these first.*

### **[Cisco NetAcad: Ethical Hacker](https://www.netacad.com/courses/ethical-hacker?courseLang=en-US)**
*   **Cost:** Free
*   **Why I recommend it:** It covers the absolute fundamentals of offensive security in a structured way. Great for building a solid foundation before jumping into tools.

### **[Hacking Scenarios (Cloud Labs)](https://hackingscenarios.com)**
*   **Cost:** Free / Paid tiers
*   **Why I recommend it:** Browser-based labs. You don't need to install VMs or configure networks. Just click and hack.

## 📖 Recommended Reading (Deep Dives)
*When I need to understand the "Why" and not just the "How." Most of these are available on O'Reilly.*

### 🧠 AI & Cybersecurity
The industry is changing fast. These are the books I use to understand how AI affects security:
*   **Developing Cybersecurity Programs in an AI-Driven World:** Good for understanding policy and high-level strategy. ([Link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/developing-cybersecurity-programs/9780138073992))
*   **Securing Generative AI:** Practical skills for securing LLMs and AI agents. ([Link](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/securing-generative-ai/9780135401804/))

### 🛠️ Hands-On Guides
*   **The Art of Hacking:** A massive collection (26+ hours) of video training. It maps well to the OSCP and CEH certifications. ([Link](https://theartofhacking.org))
*   **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity Lab:** If you want to build a home lab (which I highly recommend), this guide is essential. ([Link](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/building-the-ultimate/9780138319090/))
