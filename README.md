# 🛡️ My Cyber Security Journey

Welcome to my personal knowledge base! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey into the world of Cybersecurity. 

As I learn new concepts, solve CTFs, and explore tools, I document them here. The goal of this project is not just to store my notes, but to provide a roadmap and resources for others who are starting their journey after me.

## 🚀 Overview
Unlike a static textbook, this is a **living document**. It tracks my progress from the fundamentals to advanced topics. If you are a student, a career switcher, or a tech enthusiast, you can use this repo to see exactly what resources I used to learn specific topics.

**My Goal:** To make cybersecurity accessible by sharing "how I learned it" rather than just "what it is."

## 📂 Repository Structure
Here is how I have organized my learning path. Each folder contains notes, cheat sheets, and links to the best resources I found.

### 🔹 1. The Foundations
Before hacking, we must understand how things work.
- **[Networking-Basics](networking/)**: TCP/IP, OSI Model, Subnetting, and Protocols.
- **[Linux-Essentials](cheat-sheets/linux)**: Command line mastery, permissions, and scripting.
- **[Programming](cheat-sheets/scripting)**: Python for security and Bash scripting.

### ⚔️ 2. Offensive Security (Red Team)
Everything related to ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- **[CTF-Writeups](ctf-writeups/)**: My solutions for TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and PicoCTF.
- **[Web-Exploitation](web-exploitation/)**: OWASP Top 10, SQLi, XSS, and Burp Suite.
- **[Tools](tools/)**: How I use Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, etc.

### 🛡️ 3. Defensive Security (Blue Team)
Learning how to detect and stop the attacks.
- **[SOC-Analysis](soc-analysis/)**: Log analysis, SIEM tools, and monitoring.
- **[Digital-Forensics](dfir/)**: Analyzing artifacts and investigating incidents.

### 🎓 4. Certifications & Roadmap
- **[My-Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: The path I am currently taking.
- **[Cert-Notes](cert-notes/)**: Study guides for (e.g., CompTIA Security+, eJPT, CEH).
- **[Resources](resources.md)**: The YouTube channels, blogs, and people I follow.

## 💡 How to Use This Repo
1. **Clone it**: Keep these notes locally as a reference.
2. **Follow the Roadmap**: If you are lost, look at the order in which I learned topics.
3. **Check the Resources**: In every folder, I link the specific videos or articles that helped me understand the concept.

## 🤝 Contributing
I am currently learning, which means **I make mistakes**. 

If you spot an error in my code, a wrong explanation in my notes, or if you have a better resource to share, please feel free to open a Pull Request or an Issue! Let's learn together.

## 📜 License
This project is open-source and available to anyone who wants to learn.
