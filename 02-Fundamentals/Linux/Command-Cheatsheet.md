# 🐧 Essential Linux Commands for Hackers

**"Master the terminal, master the system."**

This is not a generic Linux tutorial. These are the specific commands and flags you will find yourself using repeatedly during CTFs and assessments.

## 🧭 Navigation & File Management

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ls -la` | List All | Shows hidden files (`.git`, `.ssh`) and permissions. |
| `cd -` | Go Back | Switches to the *previous* directory you were in. |
| `pwd` | Path | "Print Working Directory." Where am I? |
| `mkdir -p` | Make Parent | Creates a folder tree (e.g., `mkdir -p recon/nmap/scans`). |
| `cp -r` | Copy Recursive | Copies a folder and everything inside it. |
| `rm -rf` | **Nuke It** | Force deletes a folder. *Use with extreme caution.* |

## 🔍 Finding Things (The "Needle in a Haystack")

### `find`
The most powerful search tool.
```bash
# Find a file named "flag.txt" anywhere on the system
find / -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null

# Find files owned by a specific user (PrivEsc)
find / -user root -type f

# Find files with SUID bit set (PrivEsc)
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
grep

Searching inside files.

```bash
# Search for "password" in all files in the current folder
grep -r "password" .

# Search for a string but ignore case (-i)
grep -i "admin" users.txt
```
locate

Faster than find, but uses a database.

```bash 
updatedb  # Update the database first!
locate exploit.py
```
### 📝 Text Manipulation (The "Awk/Sed" Magic)

Essential for cleaning up wordlists or Nmap output.

cat / less / head / tail

Reading files.

cat file.txt: Dump entire file.

less file.txt: Scroll through file (press q to quit).

head -n 5 file.txt: Show first 5 lines.

tail -f /var/log/syslog: Watch a log file update in real-time.

sort & uniq

Organizing lists.

```bash 
# Sort a list alphabetically and remove duplicates
sort subs.txt | uniq > clean_subs.txt
```
cut

Extracting specific columns.

```bash 
# Extract userames (column 1) from /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1
```
awk

The advanced text processor.

```bash 
# Print the 4th word of every line
cat file.txt | awk '{print $4}'
```
### 🌐 Networking from Terminal
Command	Usage
ip a	Show IP
ping -c 4 <IP>	Connectivity
netstat -antp	Connections
ss -lntp	Sockets
curl -I <URL>	Headers
wget <URL>	Download
### 📦 System Info (Recon)

uname -a: Kernel version (Critical for finding kernel exploits).

whoami: Current user.

id: Current group privileges.

ps aux: List all running processes (Is there an antivirus running?).

env: Show environment variables (Look for secrets/keys).

history: Show previous commands typed by the user (Often contains passwords!).

### 🗜️ Archiving & Compression

Exfiltrating data.

Zip: zip -r data.zip folder/

Unzip: unzip data.zip

Tar (Compress): tar -czvf backup.tar.gz folder/

Tar (Extract): tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz
